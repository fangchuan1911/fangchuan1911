- 👋 @fangchuan1911. that's the guy sitting here for too long in this vaguely uncomfortable seat.  
- 👀 I'm a creative director. A writer. A linguist. A musician. I am NOT a footballer, though I wish I here. I cycle, play chess, and talk.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things, all of the time. But especially how to be a better listener.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't really know yet. Things.
- 📫 How to reach me ... a.j.selby@gmail.com.
